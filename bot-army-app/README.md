# ü§ñ Bot Army Commander

Welcome to the **Bot Army Commander** application! This is a React single-page application that allows a user to browse a collection of available bots, enlist them into a personal army, and manage their status using a local JSON server for data persistence.

## ‚ú® Features

* **View Bot Collection:** Display all available bots fetched from the mock API.
* **Enlist Bots:** Click a bot card to add it to your `YourBotArmy` section.
* **Prevent Duplicates:** A bot can only be enlisted into the army once.
* **Release Bots:** Click an enlisted bot in your army to release it (removes it from the army, but keeps it in the collection).
* **Permanent Discharge:** Click the **'X'** button on any bot card to permanently discharge the bot, deleting it from both the frontend view and the backend database (`db.json`) via a `DELETE` request.
